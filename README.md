# Hey there, I’m Rutuja 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where data, dashboards, and slightly chaotic ideas all live together.

## Who am I (in 30 seconds)?

- 🎓 Grad student in **Information Systems @ Syracuse University**
- 📊 Started in **Electronics Engineering**, fell in love with **data, analytics, and decision-making**
- 💡 I like turning messy data into **stories people can actually understand**

If something is confusing, I probably want to turn it into a chart.

## What you’ll find on this GitHub

Think of this profile as a mini tour of the things I’m curious about:

- 📈 **Markets & Finance**  
  Stock market prediction, student investing, risk dashboards, making finance feel less scary and more visual.

- 🕵️‍♀️ **AI & Trust**  
  Playing with **deepfake detection** and ML models to spot when something is just… off.

- 📊 **Dashboards & Storytelling**  
  Tableau and BI projects where I turn complex topics into visual stories for non-technical people.

## Tech I actually use

I’m comfortable with:

- **Languages:** SQL, Python, R  
- **Viz & BI:** Tableau, Power BI, Excel  
- **Data Things:** cleaning, modelling, forecasting, building dashboards, explaining results without putting people to sleep 😄

## How I got here

- I started out surrounded by circuits and signals in **Electronics Engineering**.
- Then I realised I was more obsessed with **“What does this data *mean* for decisions?”** than the hardware itself.
- That curiosity pulled me into:
  - A **Research Analyst** role at TCR Innovation working on stock market data and predictive modelling.
  - Academic and personal projects in **finance, energy, Healthcare and AI**, all with one theme:  
    > “Can I make this complex thing easier to understand?”

## Why I build things

I love that moment when someone looks at a chart or a dashboard and says:  
> “Ohhh, now I get it.”

That’s the goal of most of my work here:
- make data less intimidating,
- make risk and systems more transparent,
- and build things that help people make smarter decisions.

If you want to explore:

- 📊 **Visual storytelling:** check out my Tableau/BI projects  
- 📈 **Markets & prediction:** look at my stock market analysis + student investing dashboards  
- 🧪 **ML & experiments:** anything with “prediction”, “forecasting”, or “detection” in the name

And if any idea here sparks a thought, a question, or a “we should build this,”  
I’d love to connect. 🙂
