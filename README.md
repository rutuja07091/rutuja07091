# Hey, I’m Rutuja 👋

If you had met me a few years ago, I'd probably be surrounded by circuits and signal diagrams.

I started out in **Electronics Engineering**, fascinated by how systems work beneath the surface. But the more I learned, the more I realised what excited me most wasn’t just *how* systems worked – it was **what decisions people made because of them**. That curiosity slowly pulled me from hardware into the world of **data, analytics, and intelligent systems**.

Today, I am pursuing my **Master's in Information Systems at Syracuse University**, where I get to live at the intersection of **technology, data, and business thinking**. I have worked on projects that range from:

- **Stock market analysis and prediction** – modelling trends and building tools that make markets a little less mysterious.
- **Energy and EMS optimisation & forecasting** – figuring out how we can use resources more intelligently.
- **Deepfake detection & applied machine learning** – using ML to spot what “doesn’t look quite right” in a world full of synthetic content.
- **Student investment risk dashboards** – turning intimidating financial concepts into visual stories that first-time investors can actually understand.

and many more...


Along the way, I have worked as a **Research Analyst at TCR Innovation**, analysing stock market data and building predictive models, and I have kept sharpening my toolkit with **SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel**. For me, these aren’t just tools; they’re different ways of asking and answering better questions.

What I enjoy most is taking something messy and complex, markets, systems, behaviour, and **turning it into a clear, visual, and actionable story**. Whether it’s a dashboard, a model, or a small script, I like building things that help people say, *“Oh, now this makes sense.”*

If you’re into **data, analytics, finance, or product**, or just like building thoughtful things with data, you’ll probably enjoy wandering through some of the projects here. And if anything sparks an idea or a question, I’d love to connect. 🙂
